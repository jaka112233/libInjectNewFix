There are many tutorials for installing on youtube, Attention if your android doesn't support arm then it won't work. one of them [AIDE CMods tutorial](https://youtu.be/VYvKEFHSgkg)

## Building the source
`ndk-build`:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/ZTzTopia/GTInternalAndroid
cd GrowtopiaImGui
ndk-build
```

You need [ninja](https://ninja-build.org/) build system to use ninja cmake generator.

`cmake`:
```shell
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -GNinja -DCMAKE_MAKE_PROGRAM=/path/to/ninja.exe -DCMAKE_ANDROID_NDK=/path/to/android-ndk \
  -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=toolchains/android.cmake ..
cmake --build .
```

## Inject to growtopia
<details>
  <summary markdown="span">Android</summary>
  
  I highly recommend using [APK Tool M](https://maximoff.su/apktool) to decompile the growtopia apk. Or you can get growtopia with edited: [Growtopia Folder](https://bit.ly/2ZanMBy), so you don't need to do the tutorial below. 
  
  #### 1. Antisplit the apk
  If you see a split sign like the picture below then follow these steps:
  
  ![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/488978346697424907/901407788067069962/unknown.png)
  
  Click the growtopia apk and press antisplit as shown below:
  
  ![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/488978346697424907/901408001313894480/unknown.png)
  
  Select the apk signature as shown below:
  
  ![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/488978346697424907/901408621211029534/unknown.png)
  
  And install the growtopia apk.
  
  #### 2. Decompile growtopia apk
  Click the growtopia apk and press decompile as shown below:
  
  ![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/488978346697424907/901409650090573914/unknown.png)
  
  Do what the image below does:
  
  ![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/488978346697424907/901409767019409408/unknown.png)
  
  And press go to:
  
  ![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/488978346697424907/901409975052673054/unknown.png)
  
  #### 3. Add your library to apk
  Copy the library file (.so) from `libs` to the target game. Watch out the folder names, we don't want to mix them up, so make sure to copy our lib file to the correct architecture. Like our armeabi-v7a lib goes to the target games armeabi-v7a folder, arm64-v8a lib goes to the arm64-v8a folder...

  PUTTING THE LIB FILE ON A WRONG ARCHITECTURE LIKE PUTTING ARM64 LIB TO ARMV7 WILL RESULT A CRASH!
  
  Now go to `lib/{arch}`:
  
  ![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/488978346697424907/901410620933541898/unknown.png)
  
  You can use second tab to copy library file to target game lib:
  
  ![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/488978346697424907/901410854174613524/unknown.png)
  
  And paste library file to target game lib:
  
  ![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/488978346697424907/901410915893772328/unknown.png)
  
  #### 4. Load your library
  Now go to `smali/com/rtsoft/growtopia`:
  
  ![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/488978346697424907/901412534756724756/unknown.png)
  
  and open the `Main.smali` file, Add this code before `const-string v0, "growtopia"`.
  ```smali
  const-string v0, "ModMenu"

  invoke-static {v0}, Ljava/lang/System;->loadLibrary(Ljava/lang/String;)V
  ```
  
  Like the picture below:
  
  ![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/773831752271527946/896769601218691142/unknown.png)
  
  #### 5. Compiling game apk
  Now compile and sign the apk, and install it on your device. Congrats. You have successfully implemented a mod menu.
